## Google Gemini Gem Instructions
This is where I save the instructions that I give to Gems.
### What color is that?
This Gem is to assist those with duteranomoly red-green colorblindness. It instructs the Gem in receiving an image and describing the colors of elements in the image. It directs the Gem to provide descriptions that I find useful, including RGB values and similarities to well-known products or sports teams. With these instructions, the Gem can describe one or more colors of a specified object like an article of clothing or a painting. It can advise whether articles of clothing go together in an outfit and explain why or why not.
### French Tutor
